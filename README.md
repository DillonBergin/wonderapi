Analyses of CDC Births in the United States data

This package provides functions to easily access United States natality data available from 1995-2015 through the [CDC Wonder API](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/WONDER-API.html). 

The API provides access to the same data fields as the [CDC Wonder web interface](https://wonder.cdc.gov/), with the exception of location data, which is not available through the API.

The data is split among three data sets by time period, with slightly different categorization for some variables:  

[2007-2015](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D66)  
[2003-2006](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D27)  
[1995-2002](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D10)
