# Introduction to the CDC Natality data

The CDC natality data is documented in detail on the [CDC website] 
(https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/natality.html).  As always when working with data you need to pay careful attention to data
definitions.  In particular in the case of this data there are at least three time periods which changed the treatment of 
specific variables.  In this package we will use human readable variable names.   Here is the list of variables.
